Data Description
Target Dataset:

Near-surface air temperature data in an index format was collected on 24 July 2021 across the Bronx and Manhattan regions of New York City in the United States. The data was collected in the afternoon between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm. This dataset includes time stamps, traverse points (latitude and longitude) and the corresponding Urban Heat Island (UHI) Index values for 11229 data points. These UHI Index values are the target parameters for your model.

Note: Participants are strictly prohibited from using Longitude and Latitude values as features in building their machine learning models. Submissions that employ longitude and latitude values as model features will be disqualified. These values should only be utilized for understanding the attributes and characteristics of the locations.

Incorporating latitude and longitude data in their raw forms or through any form of manipulation—including multiplication, embedding, or conversion to polar coordinates—as predictive features in your model is strictly prohibited, as it can compromise the adaptability of your model across diverse scenarios. This prohibition extends to calculating the distance from a reference point and using it as a feature, which is essentially a transformation of the original geographical coordinates into a new feature form. Submissions that include these types of features will be considered non-compliant and will be disqualified.
